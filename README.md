Business idea: website EDUMENTOR. The clients fill the profile with the name of the desired country of education, level of education, their area of interest, financial capabilities, and so on. Based on this, our mentors offer consultations and assistance with the portfolio. In addition, the website has a partnership with the language courses and offers the clients the possibility to take courses and receive the certificate.
